+
+ 1.    INTRODUCTION
+The Fraunhofer FDK AAC Codec Library for Android ("FDK AAC Codec") is software that implements
+the MPEG Advanced Audio Coding ("AAC") encoding and decoding scheme for digital audio.
+This FDK AAC Codec software is intended to be used on a wide variety of Android devices.
+
+AAC's HE-AAC and HE-AAC v2 versions are regarded as today's most efficient general perceptual
+audio codecs. AAC-ELD is considered the best-performing full-bandwidth communications codec by
+independent studies and is widely deployed. AAC has been standardized by ISO and IEC as part
+of the MPEG specifications.
+
+Patent licenses for necessary patent claims for the FDK AAC Codec (including those of Fraunhofer)
+may be obtained through Via Licensing (www.vialicensing.com) or through the respective patent owners
+individually for the purpose of encoding or decoding bit streams in products that are compliant with
+the ISO/IEC MPEG audio standards. Please note that most manufacturers of Android devices already license
+these patent claims through Via Licensing or directly from the patent owners, and therefore FDK AAC Codec
+software may already be covered under those patent licenses when it is used for those licensed purposes only.
+
+Commercially-licensed AAC software libraries, including floating-point versions with enhanced sound quality,
+are also available from Fraunhofer. Users are encouraged to check the Fraunhofer website for additional
+applications information and documentation.
